# opendataportals

This is an learning experiment.

A collection of Australian open data portals published by ODI Queensland.

 - The data is presented using TablePress on the [ODI Queensland site](http://queensland.theodi.org/home/resources/data/).
 - A variation of the data with the policy link removed and location added is held in a Google Sheet.
 - A CSV is exported from the Google Sheet and stored here
 - A JSON Table Schema describes the table
 - A Data Package includes the Table Schema and describes the CSV
 - A competing metadata scheme, CSV on the Web by W3C, also describes the CSV
  - csv-metadata.json is generated using http://data.wu.ac.at/csvengine/csvm/editor and then edited to add restrictions
  - australian-open-data-portals.csv-metadata.json is the original hand edited file before the above generator was discovered
